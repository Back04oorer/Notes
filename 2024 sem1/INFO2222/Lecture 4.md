# User Authentication and Identification

### Introduction to Security & Usability
- **Main Focus:** User authentication and the importance of identification in digital and non-digital contexts.

## Identification Methods
- **Personal Recognition:** How friends recognize you (e.g., face, voice, common experiences).
- **Formal Identification:** Tools for unknown entities to verify your identity (e.g., ID cards, certificates).

## Digital World Identification
- **Device Recognition:** Methods your devices use to recognize you.
- **Remote Authentication:** How a remote party can be convinced of your identity.

## User Authentication Importance
- **Privilege Access:** Authentication grants access to corresponding privileges after identity confirmation.
- **Impersonation Resistance:** A basic requirement for secure authentication.

## User Authentication Ideas
- **Something You Know:** For instance, passwords for email or banking accounts.
- **Something You Have:** Such as a physical security token for secure system access.
- **Something You Are:** Using biometrics like fingerprint or facial recognition for device or facility access.

## Password-Based Authentication
- **Widespread Use:** Accessing PCs, files, and various accounts.
- **ID-Password Pair:** Initial setup and subsequent verification process.

## Password-Based Attacks: Offline vs. Online
- **Offline Attacks:** Utilizing tools to crack passwords without direct system interaction.
- **Online Attacks:** Exploiting weak web system authentication controls for unauthorized access.
- **Speed Difference:** Online attacks are limited by network speed, whereas offline attacks depend on computing power.

## Attack Strategies
- **Brute Force and Dictionary Attacks:** Targeting common passwords with high-speed attempts.
- **Rainbow Table Attacks:** Using precomputed hash tables for cracking password hashes.
- **Protection Measures:** Implementing salts in password hashes to combat rainbow table effectiveness.

## Additional Attack Vectors
- **Online Guessing:** The importance of strong passwords.
- **Exploration of Auxiliary Information:** Using leaked databases, personal information, and observing login habits.
- **Eavesdropping and Replay Attacks:** Mitigation techniques like timestamped channels and time-bound session keys.

## Password Management
- **Strong Password Generation:** Strategies and tools for creating robust passwords.
- **Password Storage:** Techniques for managing and remembering multiple strong passwords.

## Token-Based Authentication
- **Mechanisms:** Including magnetic stripe cards, optical cards, memory cards, and microprocessing chip cards.
- **Pros and Cons:** Weighing the advantages like stronger secrets and disadvantages such as the need for special readers.

## Biometric Authentication
- **Types:** Fingerprint, facial recognition, voice, iris/retina recognition.

## Multi-Factor Authentication
- **Combining Methods:** Leveraging the strengths of various authentication methods to offset individual drawbacks.
