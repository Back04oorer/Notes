Produce an extended ER diagram, that captures a conceptual design for the information that needs to be kept in a system for system to keep information about assessments in the classes at the “University of Old Times”, based on the textual description below. [The University is called that, because it insists that all students do assessments in handwriting on paper, without consulting any online sources; it also has no group assessments, only individual work.]

If there are important constraints that you could not capture in the notation of the diagram, or places where the text was ambiguous and you would have needed extra information to choose the correct properties, you need to identify these (see the indication below about Part B of the report)

The system needs to keep a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">scan of every submission</mark> made by a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">student</mark> for an <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">assessment task</mark>. A submission is handed in at a <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">date</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">time</mark> which <mark style="background: #FFFF00;">must be recorded</mark>, and it <mark style="background: #FFFF00;">may</mark> have been <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">awarded a mark</mark> by a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">staff member</mark>. The system needs to keep information for each student, including their <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">studentkey (an identifier such as JS2X57), surname, given name, year-of-entry, major(s), official email, and address</mark>. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Staff members</mark> are identified by <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">staffed</mark>, and have <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">surname</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">given name, title, department, official email, and contact phone number</mark>. Each <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">assessment task </mark><mark style="background: #00FF00;">occurs for an offering of a subject</mark> [for example, the offering of the subject Traditional Philosophy in sem1 of 2024], and the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">assessment task</mark> has <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">a name (eg “Assignment 1”), a weight towards the grade in the offering, a kind (such as Essay, Quiz, ProblemSet, FinalExam), an instruction document, and a latest-date-for-submission.</mark> Some assessment tasks are <mark style="background: #FFFF00;">non-repeatable</mark>; this means that a student may not submit for this more than once, and in that case, **there is a mechanism for the student to request an exemption for illness (the system needs to track the text of the request, the date it was made, and whether or not this was approved). For an assessment which does allow multiple submissions, we need to keep information on a policy which decides how to calculate the overall score the student gets (for example, it may be that only the latest submission is marked, or that each submission is marked and the highest mark is used, or maybe the latest submission is marked but a penalty is subtracted based on the number of submissions made).** For a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">subject</mark>, we need to know its name, the credit-hours it carries, the major(s) it counts towards [if any], and whether or not students are allowed to take it more than once. <mark style="background: #FFFF00;">The same subject may be taught over several offerings and the assessment tasks will be different between these offerings (though they may share a name!)</mark>. Each offering is taught by a staff member <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">as coordinator, and possibly there are other staff as teachers as well</mark>. The staff are each members of a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">department</mark>, and every <mark style="background: #FFFF00;">subject is under control of some department</mark>. A department may be responsible for a major (and indeed, some majors may be shared between departments, eg “Greek History” major is shared between Classics department and History department).
