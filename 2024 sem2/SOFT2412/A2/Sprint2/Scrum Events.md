### Planning Session
**Time:From 9:30 PM to 12:00 AM on October 14th** 

In this session, we used Planning Poker to estimate story points and velocity. 
First, we selected the simplest completed user story, anonymous login, as the baseline (1 point). Then, based on this baseline, we assigned points to the user stories in Sprint 1:

After the first round of voting, we did not reach a consensus on any user stories except for the anonymous login. For each user story, we asked the team members who voted as outliers to share their opinions and explain why they chose that point. For the user stories without consensus, we continued voting in rounds until we reached an agreement:

Based on this, we estimated that our **velocity** is 38, which represents the amount of work, in story points, that we can complete in one sprint (iteration).
Then we estimated the unfinished User Stories. Using the same mechanism, we estimated that the remaining User Stories have a total of 50 story points:

Finally, we selected the following User Stories as the tasks to be completed in this Sprint.

| User Story     | Story Points |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| Profile System | 8            |
| Upload         | 3            |
| Download       | 5            |
| Avatar         | 2            |
| Preview        | 20           |
| Total          | 38           |

### Daily Scrum
Our team held 15-minute stand-up meetings in person on Oct 15 and Oct 16 to discuss the project progress and set daily goals for each team member. Through these daily stand-up meetings, we ensured that all team members continued to make progress on the project and were able to solve any emerging issues in a timely manner. We mainly used this time to track progress and ensure that we could achieve our goals within the scheduled timeline.
