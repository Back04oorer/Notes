Scrum Master, Tester. As the Scrum Master, I am responsible for maintaining the Scrum board on GitHub, handling conflicts during merges, and ensuring the smooth implementation of tasks. Additionally, I organize meetings, set the discussion topics for Scrum meetings, and help coordinate communication between front-end and back-end developers. As a tester, during this sprint, I focused on testing the functions at the database interface layer and contributed to the database design from a testing perspective. After identifying bugs, I reported issues through GitHub and provided suggestions.
