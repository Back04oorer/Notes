### Planning Session
**Time:From 7:30 PM to 8:40 AM on October 14th** 

At the start of the meeting, we estimated the velocity for this sprint based on the previous sprintâ€™s velocity and the time available for this sprint. In the previous sprint, we achieved a velocity of 50 story points per sprint despite spending more time than usual. Considering the impact of other tasks, we assumed that the number of story points we could complete in this sprint would be 30.

Next, we estimated the newly introduced User Story, _Anonymous Post_, proposed by the user. First, we clarified the specific requirements of this User Story and then proceeded with the first round of voting.

In the first round, we did not reach a consensus, and there was a significant deviation in the estimates.

We allowed the outliers to explain their reasoning, and in the second round, we successfully reached an agreement

Based on the results of the second round, we concluded that the story points to be completed in this sprint would be 13.
