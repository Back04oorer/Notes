### Mingyuan Ba
 In this project, I was mainly responsible for testing, validation, and integrating different features. For test case development, I used `JUnit` to construct test cases and `Jacoco` to generate code coverage reports. After the team members clarified the requirements and code structure, I would construct the corresponding test cases to verify the behavior of the functions and ensure that they work as expected. If any issues were found, depending on the complexity of the bug and the current development progress, I would either notify the team member responsible for the feature to fix the bug or attempt to fix it myself. Once the tests passed, I would try to merge the feature branch into the main branch. If there were any conflicts that couldn't be resolved automatically, I would clarify the team members' intentions and then handle all conflicts before merging into the main branch.
