我主要负责测试,和一些bug的修复,以及Github上的一些操作,像提出issue,处理pull request, 在发现bug或者问题时revert

在这次作业中,我们使用了类似Integration-Manager Model来满足敏捷开发的要求. 具体来说
在每个iteration中,组员会先在一个独立的branch上进行开发,当组员完成或者改善了一部分的功能时,他会创建一个pull request,我会和别的组员检查并且讨论来决定这个branch能不能被merge到main.如果可以的话,他会删除这个branch,然后基于main branch 新建一个branch,进行下一个iteration的开发. 
如果在main中发现了bug, 我会revert到没有bug的版本，然后在Github上创建一个issue,然后让特定的组员去修复.


In my role, I’m mainly responsible for testing, fixing bugs, and handling tasks on GitHub, like creating issues and managing pull requests.

For this project, we followed something similar to the **Integration-Manager Model** to support agile development. 

In each iteration, the team members would start by developing on their own independent branches. Once someone had completed a feature, they’d create a pull request. At that point, I’d review it along with other team members, and we’d discuss whether that branch should be merged into the main branch. If it was approved, the branch would get deleted, and the person would create a new branch based on the latest main branch to start the next iteration of development.

Now, if we found a bug in the main branch, I’d revert the code back to a version without the bug. Then, I’d create an issue on GitHub and assign it to the right person to fix.
