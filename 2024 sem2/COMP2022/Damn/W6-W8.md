# TM
---
## Definitions
A TM $M$ like a program that:
- Can only user variables with finite domains
	- That is , *state* taking finitely many values
- Has an <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">infinite tape</mark> , made of cells
	- There is a single <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">pointer(head)</mark> on the tape
	- the pointer can move left, right, or stay
	- the pointer can read and write symbols (form a bigger tape alphabet $\Gamma$ )
	- Initially the input string over <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">input alphabet</mark> $\Sigma$ is written on the tape
	- The machine can, depending on the state, decide to Halt(stop running) and "Accept" or "Reject"
	- It is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">deterministic</mark>
	- A TM $M$ <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">accepts</mark> a string $u \in \Sigma^*$ is $M$ starting with u on the input tape, with the pointer on the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">left-most symbol</mark>, form the initial state, runs and reaches an "Accept" state
	- The language <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">recognized</mark> by $M$ (or language of M) is the set of strings it accepts
- Each instruction is of the form : `<current state> <current symbol> <new symbol> <direction> <new state>`
- **Formal Definition of TM**
	- $Q =$ set of states
	- $\Sigma=$ input alphabet
	- $\Gamma=$ tape alphabet, includes $\Sigma$ and the blank symbol `_`
	- $\delta: Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow \Gamma \times \{L,R,S\}\times Q$ is the transition function

## TM recognizable/decidable languages

##### Definitions 
- A language is **Turing-recognizable** if some TM recognizes it.
- A TM that halts on all inputs is called a **decider**
- A language is **Turing-decidable** if some decider recognizes it

## Configurations
##### Definitions
- A configuration for a TM is a string $uqv \in \Gamma^*Q\Gamma^*$
- It represents the situation in which
	- $q$ is the current state
	- the tape content is $uv$ (the infinite strings of blanks to the left and right of $uv$ are not written)
	- the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">head</mark> is at the first symbol of $v$
##### Special Configurations 
- for input string $w$, configurations of the form $q_0w$ are called <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">start configurations</mark>
- Configurations of the form $uq_{reject}v$ are called <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">rejecting configurations</mark>
- Configurations of the form $uq_{accept}v$ are called <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">accepting configurations</mark>

## TM computations
- For configurations $C,D$ write $C \vdash D$ , read $C$ yields $D$, if the TM can go from $C$ to $D$ in on step.
- Write $C \vdash_M^* D$ is the TM $M$ can go from $C$ to $D$ in any number of steps.
- The language $L(M)$ recognized by the TM $M$ consists of all strings of the form $w$ for which the computation starting with the start configuration $q_0w$ ends in an accepting configuration:
$$
L(M) = \{w \in \Sigma^*: q_0w \vdash_M^* uq_{accept}v, for\ some\ strings \ u,v\}
$$--- 

## Must-move TMs
##### Definition
TMs that are not allowed to 'stay'
##### Theorem
Every basic TM is equivalent to a must-move TM
##### Proof Idea 
simulate a basic TM by a must-move TM.
Specifically, replace each instruction that stays:
$$
q_i\ a\ b\ S\ q_j
$$
to
$$
q_i\ a\ b\ R\ q_{ij}
$$
$$
q_{ij}\ *\ * L\ q_j
$$

## Left-bounded TM

##### Definition
- The head stats on the left-most square of the tape with the head on the first letter of the input.
- Should the transition function suggest to move left when the head is already at the left-most position, the head stays put.

##### Theorem
Every basic TM is equivalent to a left-bounded TMs

##### Proof Idea
- split the left-bounded tape into 2 tracks 
- Upper track represents the right half of the tape
- Lower track represents the left half of the tape
- An extra state component keeps track of the half in which the head currently is
- At the start, mark the (leftmost) position so the TM knows when to switch between upper and lower

## Multitape TMs
##### Definition
- A multi-tape TM has multiple tapes, each with its own head of reading and writing
- Initially the input appears on tape 1, and the other start out blank
- The heads move simultaneously (not necessarily same direction)
- The type of transition of a $k$-tape TM becomes:
$$
\delta: Q \times \Gamma^k \rightarrow \Gamma^k \times \{L,R,S\}^k \times Q
$$
- Obviously every basic TM is a multi-tape TM (with k=1)

##### Theorem
Every multi-tape TM $M$ has an equivalent basic $TM$ B

##### Proof Idea
- split the tape into <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">2k many tracks</mark> of the single tape of $B$
- For each tape of $M$, use one track to store tape contents, and one track to mark head position on that tape.
- Each transition of $M$ is simulated by a series of transitions of B.

## Closure Properties ‚ùóÔ∏è

### Decidable Language
---
#### Complement ‚≠ïÔ∏è
**Theorem**: *The **complement** of a decidable language is decidable.*

**Proof**
Suppose that TM M decides language $L$.
```Python
def my_fun(x):
	return not M(x)
```
This TM decides the complement of $L$

#### Union ‚≠ïÔ∏è
**Theorem**: *The **union** of decidable languages is decidable.*

**Proof**:
Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be language that are decided by TMs $M_1$ and $M_2$ respectively. We construct a TM that decides $L_1 \cup L_2$ as follows
```Python
def my_fun(x):
	if M1(x):
		retrun 1
	if M2(x):
		return 1
	return 0
```

#### Intersection ‚≠ïÔ∏è ‚ùóÔ∏è
**Theorem**: **The *intersection* of decidable languages is decidable**

**Proof**
By De Morgan's Law for sets which says that:
$$
X \cap Y = \overline{\overline{X} \cup \overline{Y}}
$$

#### Decidable üõë ‚ùóÔ∏è
**Theorem**:
A language is decidable exactly when it and its complement are recognizable

**Proof**:
- A language is decidable $\implies$  it and its complement are recognizable
	- Since the decidable languages is closed under complement, both the language and its complement are decidable, and therefore must be recognizable
- it and its complement are recognizable $\implies$ A language is decidable
	- Let $M_1$ recognizes $L_1$, and $M_2$ recognizes $\Sigma^* \textbackslash L$ 
	- We construct a decider for $L$ as follows. On input $w$:
		- Run $M_1$ and $M_2$ in <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">parallel</mark>
			- user one tape for each machine
			- at each step, simulate $M_1$ on tape 1 and $M_2$ on tape 2
		- If $M_1$ ever accepts, then accept ; and if $M_2$ ever accepts the reject
	- The point is that for a input $w$, it must be in the $L$ or $\Sigma^* \textbackslash L$

## Decidable Problems

#### Acceptance problem for DFAs
the acceptance problem for DFAs is the language
$$
L_{DFA-acceptance} = \{D,w\ |\ D\ is\ a\ DFA\ that\ accepts\ w\}
$$
This problem is decidable
#### RE, Automata, CFGs
- The acceptance-problem for DFA,NFA, RE and CFG are decidable
- The emptiness-problem for DFA, NFA, RE, and CFG are decidable
- The equivalence-problem for DFA, NFA, and RE are decidable
#### Acceptance problem for TM
The acceptance problem for TMs is the language
$$
L_{TM-acceptance} = \{M,w\ |\ M\ is\ a\ TM\ that\ accepts\ w\}
$$
- Read M as the string encoding of the source code of a TM $M$
- This language is recognizable
- To show this we will build a TM $U$ that recognize it
- **High level description of U**
	- on input $M, w$
	- simulate $M$ on $w$
	- accept if $M$ enters $q_{accept}$ and rejects if $M$ enters $q_{reject}$ (and diverge otherwise)
	- The TM $U$ is called a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">universal TM</mark> since it can do what any other TM can do
- **is not decidable**. TM $U$ recognizes $L_{TM-acceptance}$, but it doesn't decide it
## Universal TM
Implementation level description of $U$ :
- Tape 1 holds the transition function $Œ¥_M$ of the input TM M . 
- Tape 2 holds the simulated contents of M ‚Äôs tape. 
- Tape 3 holds the current state of M , and the current position of M ‚Äôs tape head. 
- $U$ simulates M on input x one step at a time: In each step, it updates M ‚Äôs state and simulated tape contents and head position as dictated by Œ¥M . If ever M halts and accepts or halts and rejects, then U does the same.

# Undecidability

## non-recognisable language

##### Approach
To show that  a language $L$ is not Turing-recognizable, We can show that for every TM $B$, there exist some string $x$ such that either ($x \in L(B) \land x \notin L$) or ($x \notin L(B) \land x \in L$).
##### Theorem
$L_{Diag} = \{Source_M: M\ is\ a\ TM\ that\ does\ not\ accept\ Source_M\}$ is not recognizable.
##### Proof
Let $B$ be any TM, We will show $L(B) \neq L_{Diag}$ by showing that they disagree on the input $x=Source_B$.

There are 2 cases
- $Source_B \in L_{Diag}$: That is , TM $B$ does not accept $Source_B$. We have $x \in L_{Diag}\ and\ x \notin L(B)$
- $Source_B \notin L_{Diag}$: Then, TM $B$ accepts $Source_B$. We have $x \in L_{Diage}\ and\ x \notin L(B)$

## recognizable language that is not decidable

##### Theorem
There is no TM $A$ that decides $L_{TM-acceptance}$.
##### Approach
We suppose there is a decider $A$ of $L_{TM-acceptance}$ and we use it to build a TM $B$ that recognizes $L_{Diag}$, which we know is impossible.
##### Proof
Assume $A$ exists. We use $A$ to define another TM $B$:
```Python
def B(x):
	return not A(x,x)
```
So, for every TM $M$, the following are equivalent statements:
- B accepts $Source_M$
- A does not accept $Source_M$,$Source_M$
- M does not accept $Source_M$
- $Source_M \in L_{Diag}$
In other words, B decides $L_{Diag}$, which we already saw is impossible. So $A$ cannot exist.

## Proof Undecidable ‚ùì


## Time Complexity
$f(n)$ = the largest number of steps taken by the algorithm/TM on any input of length $n$.
- We say that the algorithm/TM runs in time $f(n)$.
- If $f(n) = O(p(n))$ for some polynomial $p$, then we say that the algorithm/TM <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">runs in polynomial time</mark>.

## P
Define $p$ to be the collection of languages $L$ that are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">decidable</mark> in polynomial time on **deterministic** TMs.

## Non-Deterministic TMs

##### Definition
The type of the transition function of a non-deterministic **TM** $N$ becomes:
$$
\delta: Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow P(\Gamma \times \{L, R, S\} \times Q)
$$
A computation of N on an input $u$ is a tree, called the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">computation tree</mark>.

##### Definition
A NTM $N$ accepts input $u$ if some branch of the computation tree of $u$ has an accepting configuration.
If not branch of the tree has an accepting configuration then $N$ does not accept $u$

##### Theorem
$Every\ non-deterministic$ TM $N$ has an equivalent deterministic TM $D$.
**High-level description of TM D**:
- D does a bfs of N's computation tree on given input
- If it finds $q_{accept}$, otherwise it diverges

## Complexity of NTMs
##### Definition
1. An NTM $N$ is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">decider</mark> if on every input, every branch of its computation tree halts.
2. The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">time-complexity</mark> of $N$ is the function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ where $f(n)$ is the maximum number of steps that $N$ uses on any branch of its computation on any input of length $n$.
3. If $f(n) = O(p(n))$ for some polynomial $p$ then $N$ runs in polynomial time

## NP
##### Definition
Define $NP$ to be the collection of languages $L$ that are decidable in polynomial time on **nondeterministic** Turing machines.
