## Part A Calculus

##### Question 1
$y(t) = xsinx + cosx +C$

##### Question 2
- Is Not linear
- Yes $\frac{dy}{dx} - y = x$
- Yes $\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = \frac{1}{e^x}$
- Is Not linear 

##### Question 3
- $r(x) = e^{-x}, y(x) = -x - 1 +C$
- $r(x) = e^{-2x}, y(x) = e^{-x}+Ce^{-2x}$

##### Question 4&5
- It is $tan^{-1}(y) = \frac{x^2}{2} + C$
- Is not
-
