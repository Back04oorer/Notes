The purpose of this lab was to delve into digital logic and control systems using an Arduino, a 7-segment display, and servo motors. We executed the simulation and coding on Tinkercad based on the provided tutorial and successfully transitioned the project to a physical setup in our week 5 lab session. This experience equipped me with a foundational understanding of 7-segment displays and servo motors, as well as the skills to manipulate them via Arduino programming.

% Describe the circuit you created in Part I
The circuit we created for Part I, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit_part1}, includes a 7-segment display contains 7 segments. Each segment is controlled independently by pin6 - pin12 on Arduino Uno, corresponding to segments A to G of the display. A resistor of 330-ohms is connected in series with each segment.
In addition, a button is connected to pin 2 (interrupt 0). When the button is pressed, the voltage on pin 2 changes from 1 to 0 (FALLING).

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Shortened Pseudocode for 7-Segment Counter}\label{alg:7segment_counter}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Init Booleans \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G \), \( \text{count} = 0 \)
\State Configure pins; Attach FALLING interrupt to pin 2 with handler \( x \)

\Procedure{setup}{}
    \State Init serial at 9600 bps
\EndProcedure

\Procedure{loop}{}
    \State Print pin 2 state; Update \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G \) based on \( \text{count} \)
    \State Write to pins; Delay 500 ms
\EndProcedure

\Procedure{x}{}
    \State \( \text{count} = (\text{count} + 1) \mod 10 \)
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

% Explain what this pseudocode does
The pseudocode in Algorithm~\ref{alg:7segment_counter} controls a 7-segment display with an Arduino Uno.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Init:} Boolean variables \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G \) and \( \text{count} \) initialized.
    
    \item \textbf{Pins:} Pin 2 as INPUT for button; pins 6-12 as OUTPUT for segments \( A-G \).
    
    \item \textbf{Interrupt:} Attached to pin 2 to trigger function \( x \) on button press.
    
    \item \textbf{Loop:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Debugs pin 2 state.
        \item Updates \( A-G \) based on \( \text{count} \).
        \item Writes to Arduino pins.
        \item 500-ms delay.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Function \( x \):} Increments \( \text{count} \) mod 10, updates display.
\end{itemize}

% Design decisions
\textbf{Design Decisions:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pin Selection:} Pins 6 to 12 were chosen as OUTPUT pins for segments \( G \) to \( A \) due to their proximity on the Arduino board, facilitating easier wiring. Pin 2 was chosen as the INPUT pin for the button because it supports interrupts, allowing for more efficient button press detection.
    
    \item \textbf{Use of Interrupts:} Interrupts were used to detect button presses, allowing the program to avoid constantly polling the button's state. 
    
    \item \textbf{Modular Counting:} The variable \( \text{count} \) was implemented with modular to reset after reaching 9, allowing the display to cycle back to 0.
\end{itemize}


% Limitations, Successes, Unexpected Results
\textbf{Observations:} The design successfully updates the 7-segment display on button press, utilizing modular arithmetic to back to 0 after 10 presses.

\textbf{Design Decisions}\\
Angle steps are set at 30 degrees and a 300-ms delay is used for a balance between speed and observation.

% Design decisions
\textbf{Design Decisions}

\textbf{Pin Choices:} 
I choose pins 6-12 connect to the 7-segment display for compactness. Pin 2, with interrupt capability, connects to the button for press detection. 

\textbf{Servo Control:} 
Servos connect to pins 3 and 4, which and initialize at 0 and 180 degrees .\\

% Limitations, Successes, Unexpected Results
\textbf{Limitations, Successes, and Unexpected Results}\\
\textbf{Limitations:}
The 500 ms delay in the main loop makes the system less responsive. Events happening during this half-second might be missed or delayed, causing potential error.

\textbf{Successes:}
I successfully implemented the functionality to rotate the servo motor to a angle by pressing a button, and it can also cycle back to the original position.
