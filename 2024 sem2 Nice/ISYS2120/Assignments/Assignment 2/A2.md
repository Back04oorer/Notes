Produce an extended ER diagram, that captures a conceptual design for the information that needs to be kept in a system for system to keep information about assessments in the classes at the “University of Old Times”, based on the textual description below. [The University is called that, because it insists that all students do assessments in handwriting on paper, without consulting any online sources; it also has no group assessments, only individual work.]

If there are important constraints that you could not capture in the notation of the diagram, or places where the text was ambiguous and you would have needed extra information to choose the correct properties, you need to identify these (see the indication below about Part B of the report)

The system needs to keep a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">scan of every submission</mark> made by a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">student</mark> for an <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">assessment task</mark>. A submission is handed in at a <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">date</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">time</mark> which <mark style="background: #FFFF00;">must be recorded</mark>, and it <mark style="background: #FFFF00;">may</mark> have been <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">awarded a mark</mark> by a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">staff member</mark>. The system needs to keep information for each student, including their <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">studentkey (an identifier such as JS2X57), surname, given name, year-of-entry, major(s), official email, and address</mark>. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Staff members</mark> are identified by <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">staffed</mark>, and have <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">surname</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">given name, title, department, official email, and contact phone number</mark>. Each <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">assessment task </mark><mark style="background: #00FF00;">occurs for an offering of a subject</mark> [for example, the offering of the subject Traditional Philosophy in sem1 of 2024], and the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">assessment task</mark> has <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">a name (eg “Assignment 1”), a weight towards the grade in the offering, a kind (such as Essay, Quiz, ProblemSet, FinalExam), an instruction document, and a latest-date-for-submission.</mark> Some assessment tasks are <mark style="background: #FFFF00;">non-repeatable</mark>; this means that a student may not submit for this more than once, and in that case, **there is a mechanism for the student to request an exemption for illness (the system needs to track the text of the request, the date it was made, and whether or not this was approved). For an assessment which does allow multiple submissions, we need to keep information on a policy which decides how to calculate the overall score the student gets (for example, it may be that only the latest submission is marked, or that each submission is marked and the highest mark is used, or maybe the latest submission is marked but a penalty is subtracted based on the number of submissions made).

**For a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">subject</mark>, we need to know its name, the credit-hours it carries, the major(s) it counts towards [if any], and whether or not students are allowed to take it more than once. <mark style="background: #FFFF00;">The same subject may be taught over several offerings and the assessment tasks will be different between these offerings (though they may share a name!)</mark>. Each offering is taught by a staff member <mark style="background: #FFC0CB;">as coordinator, and possibly there are other staff as teachers as well</mark>. The staff are each members of a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">department</mark>, and every <mark style="background: #FFFF00;">subject is under control of some department</mark>. A department may be responsible for a major (and indeed, some majors may be shared between departments, eg “Greek History” major is shared between Classics department and History department).

系统需要保留每个**学生**为**评估任务**提交的所有文件的扫描。提交的文件有提交的**日期**和**时间**，这些信息**必须记录**，并且提交可能已经由**工作人员**给出了**评分**。系统需要保留每个学生的信息，包括他们的**学生标识（如JS2X57）**、**姓氏**、**名字**、**入学年份**、**专业**、**官方电子邮件**和**地址**。**工作人员**由**员工ID**标识，包含他们的**姓氏**、**名字**、**职称**、**部门**、**官方电子邮件**和**联系电话**。

每个**评估任务**都对应一个**课程的开设** [例如，2024年第一学期开设的“传统哲学”课程]，评估任务有**名称**（如“作业1”）、**在该课程中的权重**、**种类**（如文章、测验、问题集、期末考试）、**说明文档**和**最后提交日期**。有些评估任务是**不可重复的**，也就是说学生不能为此提交多次。如果是不可重复的评估任务，系统需要有一个机制，让学生可以因病提出豁免申请（系统需要跟踪申请的文本、申请的日期，以及是否获得批准）。

对于允许多次提交的评估任务，系统需要记录一项政策，决定如何计算学生的总分（例如，可能只有最后一次提交会被评分，或者每次提交都被评分，取最高分，或者最后一次提交会被评分，但根据提交次数扣除分数）。

对于**课程**，我们需要知道它的名称、学分数、计入的专业（如有）以及学生是否允许多次选修**。同一门课程可能会在多个开设中教授，不同开设的评估任务可能会有所不同（尽管它们可能共享名称）。每次课程的开设由一名**工作人员作为协调员**，并且可能有其他**教师**参与教学。**工作人员**都是某个**部门**的成员，**每门课程**都由某个**部门**负责。一个部门可能负责一个专业（实际上，某些专业可能由多个部门共同负责，例如“希腊历史”专业由古典学系和历史系共同负责）。
