## Team Dynamics
**Definition:** Team dynamics are the unconscious, psychological forces that influence the direction of a team’s behaviour and performance

**Factors that lead to team dynamics**
- Personalities and work styles
- Knowledge and skills
- Organization culture and structure
- Cultural differences, background
**Pros vs Cons**
- Can be good:
	- Improve overall team performance (productive conflict, different perspectives
- Can be bad
	- Can lead to unproductive conflict can demotivate and prevent team from achieving its goals
**Tuckman Team Dev Model**
- **FORMING**: High degree of guidance needed from manager, individual roles are unclear, process not well established
- **STORMING**: Understanding how team decisions are made, purpose is clear but team relationships are blurry
- **NORMING**: Relationships are well-understood in the team, commitment to team goals, beginning to optimize processes
- **PERFORMING**: Team is performing well, focus is on being strategic, team is running well with little oversight
**Identification and Resolution**
- Investigate <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">root causes</mark> of conflicts or poor team performance
	-  Structured interviews or informal chats in a private and confidential
- Identify potential improvements
	- Team development workshops
	- Change in office layout

#### Agile Teams
- It’s claimed that agile teams work with the best developers. However, this is not necessary the case
	- Every project needs at least one<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> experienced and competent lead person</mark> (<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Critical Success Factor</mark>)
	- Each experienced and competent person on the team permits the presence of 4-5 “average” or learning peoplE
	- With that skill mix, agile techniques have been shown to work many times

#### Effective Teamwork
- Teamwork comprises of the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">right tools</mark>, the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">right people</mark> and the<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> right practices</mark>
- Effective teamwork is everyone’s shared responsibility
- Large software organizations, teams involve many roles across different departments (engineering, design, sales/marking, legal)
- Use <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">team building</mark> activities to build effective teams

#### Team Building Activities
- **Goal setting**: emphasizes the importance of c<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">lear objectives</mark> and individual and team goals
- **Interpersonal relations**: focus on teamwork skills such as giving and receiving support, communication and sharing information
- **Standup meetings**
- **Roles and responsibilities**
	- Define the roles and responsibilities that will make your team successful
	- Clarify expectations as a team
	- Helps to move a team from “<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">storming</mark>” to “<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">norming</mark>”,or help “<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">performing</mark>” teams to get back on track

#### How to define Roles and Responsibilities
- Create a table of roles and responsibilities
	- Responsibilities from **own** perspective
	- Responsibilities from **team member’s** perspective
- Identify **roles**
	-  team lead, developers, designers
	- Coarse-grained
	- Add to the role's column
- Clarify own **responsibility**
	- Think of top 3-5 tasks in priority order
	- Write on sticky notes
- Think of teammate’s responsibilities
	- Write 1-2 responsibilities for each role from your perspective
	- Write responsibilities you may think that don’t have a clear owner
- Refine and consolidate
	- Talk teammates with similar roles and refine responsibilitie
- Discuss all roles
	- Role owner(s) describe their role and place their sticky notes in own responsibility column
	- Other teammate’s role description in the other column
	- Owner to accept/decline the responsibilities by other teammates (suggest role to own it). Define primary owner for overlapping roles
	- Add “unassigned responsibilities” to
- Summarize roles and responsibilities
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">All to agree</mark>
	- Owner to document it and how to fill skill gaps
#### High-Performing Agile Teams
- **Cross-functional**; engineers, designers, architects, sales
- Mutual Respect and responsibilities
	- Not blaming culture, and/or “throw it over the wall”
- Sound engineering practices (tools and automation)
- Value and belief of agile practices and principles
- Apply agile practices effectively as individuals and as a team
- Receive continuous training (technical and non-technical) and team monitoring/coaching
## Tools and Technologies for Teamwork
#### Issue Tracking System
- A software that manages and maintains lists of issues
- Used to create, update and resolve reported issues internally or externally
- **Bug (defect) Tracking System**: keeps track of reported software bugs in software development projects
	- **Centralized** overview of development requests and their states
	- May assigned a **priority, status, severity** and/or **complexity**
	- Prioritized list of pending items (**Backlog**)
	- Typically integrated with other tools or software management systems
#### Bug/Issue Tracking Part of other Systems
- Part of **integrated project/software** development management systems
- It helps integrating issue/bug tracking **with other activities**
- Distributed bug tracking tools are designed to be used with **distributed revision control software**
#### Bug Tracking Tool
- Open-source **web-based** bug tracker and testing tool by Mozilla project
- Bug (or feature) requests can be submitted by anyone and will be assigned to a particular developer
- Various status updates for each bug
	- E.g., Bugzilla itself allows the public to file bugs – it assigns all bugs to a **gatekeeper** whose job is to assign responsibility and priority level
